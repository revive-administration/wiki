<p>
So, to sum it up:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Function</strong>
</p>

<p>
• Represents a single unit that is compiled once, and can then be called over and over.
</p>

<p>
• Does not support latent nodes.
</p>

<p>
• Has one input execution wire, and one output execution wire (Unless pure).
</p>

<p>
• Can have multiple inputs and outputs.
</p>

<p>
• Calls to functions can be replicated in network games.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Macro</strong>
</p>

<p>
• Represents a template of nodes, where each reference to it will be replaced by the actual nodes at compile time, and thus is only compiled if used.
</p>

<p>
• Supports latent nodes.
</p>

<p>
• Can have multiple input execution wires, and multiple output execution wires (Including no execution wires at all).
</p>

<p>
• Can have multiple inputs and outputs.
</p>

<p>
• Cannot be replicated, as they aren&#039;t “tangible”.
</p>
