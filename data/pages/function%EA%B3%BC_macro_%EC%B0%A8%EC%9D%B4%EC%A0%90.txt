====== Function과 Macro 차이점 ======

So, to sum it up:

**Function**

• Represents a single unit that is compiled once, and can then be called over and over.


• Does not support latent nodes.


• Has one input execution wire, and one output execution wire (Unless pure).


• Can have multiple inputs and outputs.


• Calls to functions can be replicated in network games.


**Macro**

• Represents a template of nodes, where each reference to it will be replaced by the actual nodes at compile time, and thus is only compiled if used.


• Supports latent nodes.


• Can have multiple input execution wires, and multiple output execution wires (Including no execution wires at all).


• Can have multiple inputs and outputs.


• Cannot be replicated, as they aren't "tangible".
