* Submission Due : June 5, Friday
  * Presentation : June 10 Wed or 12 Fri
  * Evaluation : Demo + Presentation + Final Document (Design / implementation / Test Report)
  * Project Description
    * Goal is to develop a DSM tool helping the software designers to understand the overall dependencies of the software modules so that they can manage/improve the software design. Its basic functionalities include edit and visualize DSM. You may want to refer to a similar extant product such as Titan which you can download from the eclass website. (Go to class materials for DSM tutorial - Titan)
    * Titan is a DSM viewer tool that accepts DSM(.dsm) files. After opening a DSM, the user can also load a clustering file(.clsx) to order the DSM in the predefined order. Or, the user can cluster the DSM using the GUI of Titan and save the clustering into a .clsx file
  
  * Submission Materials
    * Final document
      * program description
      * overall design (class diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc)
      * must explain how MVC architectural pattern was applied to your design
      * must explain major design decisions you made and their pros/cons
      * must explain how your program was tested
      * must explain how object-oriented design principles were applied to your program
      * usage of your program and the screen shots of examples
  * I/O Requirement
    * Your program should be able to read .dsm and .clsx files which are generated by Titan. Refer to the samples in "data dir" for detailed file foramt. Also, the .dsm and .clsx files generated by your program should be readable by Titan, too. 

  * Functional Requirement
    * On top of the functions provided in Titan, there are two major extensions to Titan for this term project
    * (1) Your program should allow the user to edit (i.e., add and delete) the dependencies between the modules and edit (i.e., add, delete, rename) the modules.
    * (2) Your program should provide the functionality of duplicate/fork a subsystem. (See the description for Right-click at group in left panel)
