====== Benefits of Encapsulation ======
benefits of data encapsulation 
  * protection of implementation (safety) : clients cannot directly access encapsulated
data
  * readability (understandability) : clients of interface does not need to know any
knowledge as to how the functions that describe the interface use encapsulated
information
  * implementation independence : A change in implementation should not affect the
interface seen by the clients of a class. An encapsulated implementation provides the
implementor freedom to change it without affecting the interface. i.e. how the clients use
the interface is independent of the implementation
