  * Memory Hierarchy
    * Fast memories are small, large memories are slow
    * GOAL : "size of the cheapest memory, with speed of fastest memory"
    * Principle of Locality
      * Programs use a small part of their memory space frequently

  * Caching
    * Direct mapped, Fully associative, M-way set associative
    * Cache performance
      * Hit vs miss, miss penalty, block size
      * Replacement policy and writing
    * Error checking & Correcting code
      * Parity bit and Hamming code
    * Virtual memory
      * Address Transition, Paging, Page Table, TLB
