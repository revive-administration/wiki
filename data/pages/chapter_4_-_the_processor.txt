  * How to implements the instructions in the hardware?
    * Single-cycle processor
    * Pipelined processor
  * Pipelining improves instruction through using parallelism
    * More instructions completed per second
    * Latency for each instruction not reduced
  * Hazards : structural, data, control
    * forwarding, stall
  * ISA influences design of datapath and control
    * Datapath and control influence design of ISA
