====== Lecture 2.1 - Higher-Order functions ======
Functional languager treat functions as first-class values.

This means that, like any other value, a function can be passed as a parameter and returned as aresult.

This provides a flexible way to compose programs.

Functions that take other functions as parameters or that return functions as results are called higher order functions
