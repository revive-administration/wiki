  * Operations on integers
    * Addition and subtraciton, Multiplication and division, Dealing with overflow
  * Floating-point real numbers
    * Representation and operations (float & double)
  * Computer representations of numbers
    * Finite range, precision, accuracy
      * rounding control
      * extra bits of precision (guard, round, sticky)
      * choice of rounding modes (up, down, truncate, nearest even, away from 0)
    * Need to account for this in programs
  * Bits have no inherent meaning
    * Interpretation depends on the instructions applied
